A TypeScript library for building Bots with [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) in a functional, composable and declarative way.

If you're unfamiliar with Puppeteer, here's the description from their website:

> Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

With Puppeteer, you can automate your social media, take screenshots or generate PDF's of websites and much more!

With [Botmation](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation), you can write less Puppeteer code and do more. By following its simple architectural pattern, your code will be easily readable, testable, and *composable* (reusable without limits).

This library provides an avenue for newcomers in Functional programming, to learn at their own pace.
