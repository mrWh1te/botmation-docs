[Botmation](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation) is a simple, functional, TypeScript framework for building web bots in a composable and declarative way.

It's built with [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), a NodeJS library that provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

With [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), it's few steps away from building web bots that automate your social media, take screenshots & generate PDF's of websites, surf while scraping the web and much more. 🌊🏄

With [Botmation](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation), you get a simple, scalable, declarative pattern to build Puppeteer web bots. It reduces code reusing barriers with *composition* and maximizes your web bots' code *readability*, *maintainability* and *testability*.
