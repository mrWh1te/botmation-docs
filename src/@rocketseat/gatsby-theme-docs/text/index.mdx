[Botmation](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation) is a simple TypeScript framework for building web bots in a functional, composable and declarative way.

It's built on top of [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), a NodeJS library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

With Puppeteer, you can automate your social media, take screenshots or generate PDF's of websites and much much more!

Combined with [Botmation](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation), you can spend less time writing and maintaining Puppeteer code and more time solving high level problems. Botmation provides a simple declarative pattern to maintain your Puppeteer code as easily readable, testable, and *composable* (reusable without limits) while it scales.

Botmation uses a few simple concepts from Functional programming, provides a learn at your own pace collection of functions, with the intention of easing efforts in beginning a new Functional programming journey.
