A TypeScript library for building Bots with [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) in a declarative, functional, composable way.

If you're unfamiliar with Puppeteer, here's the description from their website:

> Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

With Puppeteer, you can automate your social media, take screenshots, generate PDF's and much more!

With Botmation, you can do all that with less code by following a simple architecture pattern that makes code readable, testable & composable (reusable without limits), and bootstrap your code with a collection of functions, to get you started faster.
