These BotAction's focus on reading and writing files to local disk, such as taking a saving a PNG screenshot or saving a PDF of the whole page.

These functions, and the [Cookies' BotAction's](/api/cookies), are all compatible with the higher-order `files()()` BotAction to inject an enriched (hydrated with safe defaults) `BotFileOptions` for all assembled actions.

> BotAction's that implement the `BotFilesAction` interface, type their `injects` a little more specifically to expect `BotFileOptions` as the first one. This is what `files()()` does to its assembled BotAction's.

## Files
A higher-order `BotAction` that will take a partial of `BotFileOptions`, enrich them with safe defaults, then inject it as the first inject for all assembled BotAction's in the second call. 

```typescript
const files = (fileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>) =>
  (...actions: BotAction[]): BotAction =>
    inject(enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults(fileOptions))(
      errors('files()()')(...actions)
    )
```
Works great for BotAction's implementing the `BotFilesAction` interface.

For an usage example, see the [Instagram example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/master/src/examples/instagram.ts).

## Screenshot
Takes a screenshot of the current page, where ever it's scrolled too, and saves it as a PNG file with the given file name. 
```typescript
const screenshot = (fileName: string, botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>): BotFilesAction => 
  async (page, options) => {
    const hydratedOptions = enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults({...options, ...botFileOptions})

    const fileUrl = getFileUrl(hydratedOptions.screenshots_directory, hydratedOptions, fileName) + '.png'
    await page.screenshot({path: fileUrl})
  }
```
By default, saves the file in the local directory. You can change the directory where it's saved by overloading the `BotFileOptions`.

For an usage example, see the [Screenshots Bot](/examples#screenshots-bot).

## Screenshot All
Takes one screenshot of each URL provided. Filenames are created from urls by replacing nonsafe characters with underscores.

```typescript
const screenshotAll = (urls: string[], botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>): BotFilesAction => 
  async(page, options) => {
    const hydratedOptions = enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults({...options, ...botFileOptions})

    await forAll(urls)(
      url => ([
        goTo(url),
        screenshot(url.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '_'))
      ])
    )(page, hydratedOptions)
  }
```
By default, saves the file in the local directory. You can change the directory where it's saved by overloading the `BotFileOptions`.

Example:
```typescript
await chain(
  screenshotAll('https://google.com', 'https://twitter.com')
)(page)
```

## Save PDF
Saves a PDF of the entire web page.
```typescript
const savePDF = (fileName: string, botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>): BotFilesAction => async(page, options) => {
  const hydratedOptions = enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults({...options, ...botFileOptions})

  const fileUrl = getFileUrl(hydratedOptions.pdfs_directory, hydratedOptions, fileName) + '.pdf'

  await page.pdf({path: fileUrl, format: 'A4'})
}
```
By default, saves the file in the local directory. You can change the directory where it's saved by overloading the `BotFileOptions`.

Example:
```typescript
await chain(
  goTo('https://google.com'),
  savePDF('google-homepage') // saves: google-homepage.pdf
)(page)
```

## Helpers

Botmation consolidates all BotAction's that read and write files to disk with the same Helpers to maintain consistency with how these files are managed.

If you're going to make other Local Disk related BotFilesAction's, please use these Helpers.

### enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults()
This Helper standardizes the directory structure for file management. The word "enrich" in this project is like "hydrating" models, with the focus on safe defaults that don't break program execution.

```typescript
enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults = (options: Partial<BotFileOptions> = {}): BotFileOptions => ({
  screenshots_directory: '',
  pdfs_directory: '',
  cookies_directory: '',
  ...options
})
```
The safe defaults is the local directory.

Let's look at the data structure [BotFileOptions](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/1a689d3691e84aaf30318d0b3c56447e299bbd8b/src/botmation/interfaces/bot-file-options.ts#L14):
```typescript
interface BotFileOptions {
  parent_output_directory?: string
  screenshots_directory: string
  pdfs_directory: string  
  cookies_directory: string
}
```
`parent_output_directory` is optional. It designates a directory ie "assets", "files", etc for all Files. If you specify any other directory, they will be put inside that `parent_output_directory`.

Otherwise, you can put the files in their own directories, locally.

### createFolderURL()
Creates a folder url based on the names passed in with a pattern of starting with `.` (local) followed by each folder name with a preceding `/`.

```typescript
const createFolderURL = (...folderNames: string[]): string => 
  folderNames.reduce((folderUrl, folderName) => folderUrl + '/' + folderName, '.')
```
Does not append a backslash. Therefore, can be used to create partial URL's or complete directory and filename URL's.

### getFileUrl()
Builds a URL for the requested file type (specific directory option in `BotFileOptions`), and uses provided `BotFileOptions` to build a URL with the file name to the managed File.

```typescript
const getFileUrl = (fileDirectory: string, filesOptions: BotFileOptions, fileName: string = ''): string => {
  const fileNameWithPrefix = fileName === '' ? '' : '/' + fileName 

  if (filesOptions?.parent_output_directory) {
    if (fileDirectory) {
      return createFolderURL(filesOptions.parent_output_directory, fileDirectory) + fileNameWithPrefix
    }

    return createFolderURL(filesOptions.parent_output_directory) + fileNameWithPrefix
  }

  if (fileDirectory) {
    return createFolderURL(fileDirectory) + fileNameWithPrefix
  }
  
  return './' + fileNameWithPrefix
}
```
