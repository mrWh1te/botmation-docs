These BotAction's focus on reading and writing files to local disk, such as taking a saving a PNG screenshot or saving a PDF of the whole page.

These functions, and the [Cookies' BotAction's](/api/cookies), are all compatible with the higher-order `files()()` BotAction to inject an enriched (hydrated with safe defaults) `BotFileOptions` for all assembled actions.

> BotAction's that implement the `BotFilesAction` interface, type their `injects` a little more specifically to expect `BotFileOptions` as the first one. This is what `files()()` does to its assembled BotAction's.

## Files
A higher-order `BotAction` that will take a partial of `BotFileOptions`, enrich them with safe defaults, then inject it as the first inject for all assembled BotAction's in the second call. 

```typescript
const files = (fileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>) =>
  (...actions: BotAction[]): BotAction =>
    inject(enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults(fileOptions))(
      errors('files()()')(...actions)
    )
```
Works great for BotAction's implementing the `BotFilesAction` interface.

For an usage example, see the [Instagram example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/master/src/examples/instagram.ts).

## Screenshot
Takes a screenshot of the current page, where ever it's scrolled too, and saves it as a PNG file with the given file name. 
```typescript
const screenshot = (fileName: string, botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>): BotFilesAction => 
  async (page, options) => {
    const hydratedOptions = enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults({...options, ...botFileOptions})

    const fileUrl = getFileUrl(hydratedOptions.screenshots_directory, hydratedOptions, fileName) + '.png'
    await page.screenshot({path: fileUrl})
  }
```
By default, saves the file in the local directory. You can change the directory where it's saved by overloading the `BotFileOptions`.

For an usage example, see the [Screenshots Bot](/examples#screenshots-bot).

## Screenshot All
Takes one screenshot of each URL provided. Filenames are created from urls by replacing nonsafe characters with underscores.

```typescript
const screenshotAll = (urls: string[], botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>): BotFilesAction => 
  async(page, options) => {
    const hydratedOptions = enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults({...options, ...botFileOptions})

    await forAll(urls)(
      url => ([
        goTo(url),
        screenshot(url.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '_'))
      ])
    )(page, hydratedOptions)
  }
```
By default, saves the file in the local directory. You can change the directory where it's saved by overloading the `BotFileOptions`.

Example:
```typescript
await chain(
  screenshotAll('https://google.com', 'https://twitter.com')
)(page)
```

## Save PDF
Saves a PDF of the entire web page.
```typescript
const savePDF = (fileName: string, botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>): BotFilesAction => async(page, options) => {
  const hydratedOptions = enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults({...options, ...botFileOptions})

  const fileUrl = getFileUrl(hydratedOptions.pdfs_directory, hydratedOptions, fileName) + '.pdf'

  await page.pdf({path: fileUrl, format: 'A4'})
}
```
By default, saves the file in the local directory. You can change the directory where it's saved by overloading the `BotFileOptions`.

Example:
```typescript
await chain(
  goTo('https://google.com'),
  savePDF('google-homepage') // saves: google-homepage.pdf
)(page)
```
