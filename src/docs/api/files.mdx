These focus on building and saving files to the local disk like taking a screenshot of the current window or generating a PDF of the whole page.

These functions, and the Cookies' actions, are all compatible with the higher-order `files()()` BotAction to customize the `injects` with `BotFileOptions` for all assembled actions. The `BotFilesAction` interface types the `injects` expected when assembled inside `files()()`.

## Files
```typescript
files(fileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>) => 
  (...actions: BotAction[]) => BotAction
```
A higher-order `BotAction` that will take a partial of `BotFileOptions`, enrich them with safe defaults, then inject it as the first inject for all assembled actions in the second call.

## Screenshot
```typescript
screenshot(fileName: string) => BotFilesAction
```
Takes a screenshot of the current page, where ever it's scrolled too, and saves it as a PNG file with the given file name.

You can change the directory where it's saved by overloading the `BotFileOptions`.

## Screenshot All
```typescript
screenshotAll(...urls: string[]) => BotFilesAction
```
Simple Bot Action, for taking a screenshot of multiple site pages. Provide a comma separated list of URL strings ie `screenshotAll('https://google.com', 'https://twitter.com')`. It will create the screenshots in the current active directory, which can be adjusted by overloading `BotFileOptions`.

## Save PDF
```typescript
savePDF(fileName: string, botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>) => BotFilesAction
```
Simple Bot Action, for taking a screenshot of multiple site pages. Provide a comma separated list of URL strings ie `screenshotAll('https://google.com', 'https://twitter.com')`. It will create the screenshots in the current active directory, which can be adjusted by overloading `BotFileOptions`.
