These BotAction's scrape the page's `document` with a HTML parser. The default parser is [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio).

You can override the HTML parser via higher-order param, or as the first [inject](/advanced/injects). 

## HTML Parser
A higher-order BotAction that will take a function to set as the first [inject](/advanced/injects) for assembled BotAction's. This function, if not overriden with a higher-order version, is applied on the string form of the scraped HTML.

> If you are trying to use a Class, just create a function that references it and maybe creates an instance from it's Constructor to return that. The HTML parser function is ran in NodeJS, *not* evaluated in the page.

```typescript
const htmlParser = (htmlParser: Function) =>
  (...actions: BotAction[]): BotAction => 
    pipe()(
      inject(htmlParser)(
        errors('htmlParser()()')(...actions)
      )
    )
```
Works great for BotAction's implementing the `ScraperBotAction` interface.
