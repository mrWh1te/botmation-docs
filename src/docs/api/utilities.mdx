These BotAction's provide logical branching and looping in a functional manner.

These functions are both fun to play with and can reduce your overall code, while keeping it declarative and functional.

> The assembled BotAction's are ran in a Pipe.

## Given That
A functional "if statement".
```typescript
const givenThat = 
  (condition: ConditionalBotAction) => 
    (...actions: BotAction<PipeValue|void|AbortLineSignal>[]): BotAction<any> => 
      async(page, ...injects) => {
        const resolvedConditionValue: AbortLineSignal|boolean = await condition(page, ...pipeInjects(injects))

        if (isAbortLineSignal(resolvedConditionValue)) {
          return processAbortLineSignal(resolvedConditionValue)
        }

        if (resolvedConditionValue) {
          const returnValue: PipeValue|AbortLineSignal = await pipe()(...actions)(page, ...injects)

          if (isAbortLineSignal(returnValue)) {
            return returnValue
          }
        }
      }
```
Takes an async function, similar to a `BotAction` (same parameters but called a [ConditionalBotAction](/advanced/conditionals#conditional-botaction)) that is expected to return a promise that resolves to a Boolean value. If that promise resolves to `true`, only then, will it run the assembled actions.

This Utility BotAction has unique aborting behavior. First, the ConditionalBotAction can return an AbortLineSignal which is processed normally and returned, aborting the BotAction. Secondly, if an assembled BotAction returns an AbortLineSignal, it aborts the line, except it won't return an AbortLineSignal `pipeValue`. In order to do that, it takes at least `assembledLines` of 2. That's in order to keep this function type-safe with Chain's.

The [example Instagram bot](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/master/src/examples/instagram.ts), uses `givenThat()()`, to attempt login, only if the bot is a Guest on the page then only operates as a logged in User, after checking if the bot is logged in on the page.

## For All
It's a functional "forEach loop".
```typescript
const forAll =
  (collection?: Collection) =>
    (botActionOrActionsFactory: (...args: [any, string, Collection]) => BotAction<any>[] | BotAction<any>): BotAction<any> =>
      async(page, ...injects) => {
        if (!collection) {
          collection = getInjectsPipeValue(injects)
        }

        if (!collection) {
          logWarning('Utilities forAll() missing collection')
          return
        }

        let returnValue: AbortLineSignal|PipeValue

        if (Array.isArray(collection)) {
          for(let index = 0; index < collection.length; index++) {
            injects = removePipe(injects)
            injects.push(wrapValueInPipe([collection[index], index+'', collection]))

            returnValue = await pipeActionOrActions(botActionOrActionsFactory(collection[index], index+'', collection))(page, ...injects)

            if (isAbortLineSignal(returnValue)) {
              return processAbortLineSignal(returnValue)
            }
          }
        } else {
          if (isDictionary(collection)) {
            for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(collection)) {
              injects = removePipe(injects)
              injects.push(wrapValueInPipe([value, collection, key]))
  
              returnValue = await pipeActionOrActions(botActionOrActionsFactory(value, key, collection))(page, ...injects)

              if (isAbortLineSignal(returnValue)) {
                return processAbortLineSignal(returnValue)
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
```
This `BotAction` takes a collection, either an array of any type or a simple json object with key/value pairs, to iterate with a callback function that returns a Bot Action or an array of Bot Action's to run in.

It's possible to pipe in the `collection` as the first `forAll()` call's parameter is optional.

This function assembles a line of BotAction's with each loop iteration, it runs many BotAction lines. Therefore, it has advanced [aborting](/advanced/aborting) behavior to give granular control. Here's a table to understand the effects AbortLineSignal's have with varying `assembledLines` counts:

| assembledLines | effect                                                         |
|       -        |         -                                                     |
| 1              | break the loop iteration line, but do not abort the loop       |
| 2+             | break the loop iteration line, break the loop and return the AbortLineSignal with 2 assembledLines processed        |

The [screenshotAll()](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/master/src/botmation/actions/files.ts) Bot Action wraps the `forAll()()` Bot Action, to run `goTo()` and `screenshot()` actions, on a collection of urls provided.

## For As Long
It's a functional "while loop".

```typescript
const forAsLong = 
  (condition: ConditionalBotAction) => 
    (...actions: BotAction[]): BotAction<any> => 
      async(page, ...injects) => {
        let returnValue: PipeValue|AbortLineSignal
        let resolvedCondition = await condition(page, ...pipeInjects(injects))

        if (isAbortLineSignal(resolvedCondition)) {
          return processAbortLineSignal(resolvedCondition)
        }

        while (resolvedCondition) {
          returnValue = await pipe()(...actions)(page, ...pipeInjects(injects))

          if (isAbortLineSignal(returnValue)) {
            return processAbortLineSignal(returnValue)
          }

          resolvedCondition = false
          resolvedCondition = await condition(page, ...pipeInjects(injects))

          if (isAbortLineSignal(resolvedCondition)) {
            return processAbortLineSignal(resolvedCondition)
          }
        }
      }
```
It resolves the [ConditionalBotAction](/advanced/conditionals#conditional-botaction) before running the actions each time. It stops looping if the condition resolves False or rejects.

To support granular aborting, it takes two `assembledLines` in an AbortLineSignal to fully abort out of `forAsLong()()`. An AbortLineSignal with 1 `assembledLines` will abort a loop iteration line of BotAction's, but not the loop itself. It's similar to [forAll()()](/api/utilities#for-all), except the ConditionalBotAction of the first `forAsLong()` call can return an AbortLineSignal, which is handled normally. Therefore, if a ConditionalBotAction returns an AbortLineSignal with one `assembledLines`, it aborts fully out of this BotAction.

For a concept example, see [Loops: For As Long](/advanced/loops#for-as-long).

## Do While
It's a functional "doWhile loop".

```typescript
const const doWhile = 
  (condition: ConditionalBotAction) => 
    (...actions: BotAction<any>[]): BotAction<any> => 
      async(page, ...injects) => {
        let returnValue: PipeValue|AbortLineSignal
        let resolvedCondition: boolean|AbortLineSignal = true
        while (resolvedCondition) {
          returnValue = await pipe()(...actions)(page, ...injects)

          if (isAbortLineSignal(returnValue)) {
            return processAbortLineSignal(returnValue)
          }

          resolvedCondition = false
          resolvedCondition = await condition(page, ...pipeInjects(injects))

          if (isAbortLineSignal(resolvedCondition)) {
            return processAbortLineSignal(resolvedCondition)
          }
        }
      }
```
It runs the BotAction's first, then resolves the [ConditionalBotAction](/advanced/conditionals#conditional-botaction) as to whether or not it should run the actions again. It will keep running the pipe of Botaction's in a loop until the condition resolves `false` or rejects.

This BotAction follows the same aborting behavior as [forAsLong()()](/api/utilities#for-as-long). The ConditionalBotAction can abort the function normally, while assembled BotAction's can abort a loop iteration line only, or that and abort the `doWhile()()` BotAction.

For a concept example, see [Loops: Do While](/advanced/loops#do-while).
