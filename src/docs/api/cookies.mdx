These BotActions provide the means to manage cookies from a Puppeteer page.

`BotFileOptions` is used to specify the directory for saving and loading cookies, relative to the bot's executing directory.

These functions are compatible with the higher-order [files()() BotAction](/api/files#files) to inject a customized `BotFileOptions` into each assembled BotAction. That allows you to standardize the directory for all assembled BotActions that are reading and writing files.

## Save Cookies
Saves the cookies from the Puppeteer page in a JSON file with the name provided.

```typescript
const saveCookies = (fileName: string, botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>): BotFilesAction => async(page, options: Partial<BotFileOptions>) => {
  const hydratedOptions = enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults({...options, ...botFileOptions})

  const cookies = await page.cookies()
  await fs.writeFile(getFileUrl(hydratedOptions.cookies_directory, hydratedOptions, fileName) + '.json', JSON.stringify(cookies, null, 2))
}
```
`BotFileOptions` is optional, in all cases (higher-order param, as an inject). If nothing is provided, the default is the local directory.

See [enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults](/api/files#enrichbotfileoptionswithdefaults) for details on setting the directory for files read and created.

For an usage example, see the [Instagram example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/master/src/examples/instagram.ts), where saving and loading cookies enables the Bot to skip the login flow on subsequent runs, as long as the cookies saved, have not yet expired.

## Load Cookies
Loads the cookies from the file name specified into the Puppeteer page.

```typescript
const loadCookies = (fileName: string, botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>): BotFilesAction => async(page, options) => {
  const hydratedOptions = enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults({...options, ...botFileOptions})

  const file = await fs.readFile(getFileUrl(hydratedOptions.cookies_directory, hydratedOptions, fileName) + '.json')
  const cookies = JSON.parse(file.toString())

  for (const cookie of cookies) {
    await page.setCookie(cookie)
  }
}
```
`BotFileOptions` is optional, in all cases (higher-order param, as an inject). If nothing is provided, the default is the local directory.

See [enrichBotFileOptionsWithDefaults](/api/files#enrichbotfileoptionswithdefaults) for details on setting the directory for files read and created.

For an usage example, see the [Instagram example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/master/src/examples/instagram.ts), where saving and loading cookies enables the Bot to skip the login flow on subsequent runs, as long as the cookies saved, have not yet expired.

## Get Cookies

This BotAction returns all cookies for the inputted URL's. When no URL's are specified, it will return the cookies for the current URL only.

```typescript
const getCookies = (...urls: string[]): BotAction<Protocol.Network.Cookie[]> => async(page) =>
  page.cookies(...urls)
```

## Delete Cookies

This BotAction deletes all cookies provided.

```typescript
const deleteCookies = (...cookies: Protocol.Network.Cookie[]): BotAction => async(page, ...injects) => {
  if (cookies.length === 0) {
    if (injectsHavePipe(injects)) {
      const pipeValue = getInjectsPipeValue(injects)
      if (Array.isArray(pipeValue) && pipeValue.length > 0) {
        cookies = pipeValue
      }
    }
  }

  if (cookies.length > 0) {
    return page.deleteCookie(...cookies)
  }
}
```

It's intended to be paired with [getCookies](#getcookies) to designate which cookies are to be deleted. For example:

```typescript
pipe()(
  getCookies(),
  deleteCookies()
)(page)
```
This will grab all cookies, for the current URL, then pipe those cookies into `deleteCookies` for deletion. Otherwise, specify the cookies via the higher-order parameter:

```typescript
chain(
    deleteCookies(cookie1, cookie2, cookie3)
)(page)
```

> If both higher-order params and pipe values are used, this will, like every other BotAction, use the higher-order param instead
