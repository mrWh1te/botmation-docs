A highly composable BotAction for setting the first few `injects` in a new line of actions while appending the higher order `injects` at the end.

## Inject
```typescript
inject(...newInjects: any[]) => 
  (...actions: BotAction<PipeValue|void>[]) => BotAction<any>
```
It is used to compose higher-order injecting assembly-line functions like `files()()` or `indexedDBStore()()`.
