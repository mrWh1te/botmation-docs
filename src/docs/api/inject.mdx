A highly composable BotAction for setting the first set of [injects](/advanced/injects) in a new line of BotAction's while appending the higher order `injects` at the end.

## Inject
This higher-order BotAction is useful for composing BotAction's that inject a particular set of stuff into assembled BotAction's. [files()()](/api/files#files) and [indexedDBStore()()](/api/indexeddb#indexeddbstore) are both composed with `inject()()`.

```typescript
const inject =
  (...newInjects: any[]) => 
    (...actions: BotAction<PipeValue|void>[]): BotAction<any> => 
      async(page, ...injects) => 
        await assemblyLine()(...actions)(page, ...newInjects, ...injects)
```
Here is an usage [example](/advanced/injects#inject-botaction).
