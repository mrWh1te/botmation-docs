If you just want to play with this project without setting one up yourself, the quickest way is to:

1) Clone this repo locally
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mrWh1te/Botmation.git
cd Botmation
```

2) Install the npm dependencies while ignoring scripts: 
```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
```
3) Rebuild the Puppeteer dependency (run its scripts): 
```bash
npm rebuild puppeteer
```

4) Edit the Playground Bot's source code: `./src/playground_bot.ts`

5) After each playground change, build the project code: 
```bash
npm run build
```

6) Run the built playground bot: 
```bash
npm run playground
```

You can also edit and run each example with their own command:
```bash
npm run examples/simple_objectoriented
npm run examples/simple_functional
npm run examples/instagram
npm run examples/screenshots
npm run examples/pdf
```

Have fun!
