title: 'Playground'
---

Botmation has a specific file for experimenting around with new concepts, functions, ideas, etc called Playground.

It's located here: `./src/playground_bot.ts`

The fastest way to get started with Botmation, without setting up a project yourself, is to clone the repo locally, then work from that bot's code, build source then run it.

## Clone Botmation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mrWh1te/Botmation.git
cd Botmation
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
```

## Run Puppeteer build script

```bash
npm rebuild puppeteer
```

## Edit Playground source
`./src/playground_bot.ts`

## Build Botmation source
Includes all examples and the playground.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Run Playground bot

```bash
npm run playground
```

## Run examples

```bash
npm run examples/simple_objectoriented
npm run examples/simple_functional
npm run examples/screenshots
npm run examples/pdf
npm run examples/instagram
npm run examples/linkedin
```

Have fun!
