title: Concurrency
---

There is a great open-source npm module for running concurrent Puppeteer Chromium instances called [puppeteer-cluster](https://github.com/thomasdondorf/puppeteer-cluster).

## Functional bots ran concurrently
Since [BotAction's](/overview#botaction-functions) operate solely on Puppeteer pages, you can combine Botmation and Puppeteer-Cluster to run functional web bots concurrently.

Here is a simplified version of the [puppeteer-cluster example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/master/src/examples/puppeteer-cluster.ts):
```typescript
import { Cluster } from 'puppeteer-cluster'

(async () => {
  try {
    const cluster = await Cluster.launch({
        concurrency: Cluster.CONCURRENCY_BROWSER,
        maxConcurrency: 3
    })

    const screenshotBotForClustering = async ({ page, data: url }: {page: Page, data: any}) => 
        await chain(
            goTo(url),
            screenshot(url.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '_')),
            log('screenshot of ' + url + ' saved')
        )(page)

    cluster.queue('https://nodejs.org/', screenshotBotForClustering)
    cluster.queue('https://github.com/', screenshotBotForClustering)
    cluster.queue('https://www.typescriptlang.org/', screenshotBotForClustering)

    await cluster.idle()
    await cluster.close()

  } catch(error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
})()
```

## Dynamic Clustering Bots
To create a Bot for clustering (bots in a cluster are ran concurrently), you can create an async function that takes an object `{page: Page, data: any}` as a param, for dynamically queueing the Puppeteer code, multiple times with varying options like starting URL.

Check out [puppeteer-cluster](https://github.com/thomasdondorf/puppeteer-cluster) for great documentation on all that's possible.
