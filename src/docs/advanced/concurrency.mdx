Use the [puppeteer-cluster](https://github.com/thomasdondorf/puppeteer-cluster) module to run Bots concurrently!

To get started, check out the [examples/puppeteer-cluster.ts](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/master/src/examples/puppeteer-cluster.ts) on how to set up multiple bots. You can use both the Object-Oriented class or go purely Functional. The example has both. 

If you have setup the [Playground Bot](/getting-started#playground-bot), you can build the code and try out the cluster example:

```bash
npm run build && npm run examples/puppeteer-cluster
```
