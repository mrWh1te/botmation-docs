## AbortLine Signal

Sometimes it's necessary to abort an assembly line of BotAction's. Perhaps something is removed from a web page that subsequent BotAction's rely on. When this happens, all a BotAction must do is return an `AbortLineSignal`.

```typescript
type AbortLineSignal = {
  brand: 'Abort_Signal',
  assembledLines: number,
  pipeValue?: PipeValue
}
```

AbortLine signals are safely created with the [createAbortLineSignal()](/api/abort#createabortlinesignal) helper.

### Assembled Lines Count

An AbortLine signal has an important property called `assembledLines` which informs the assembler how many lines of assembly to break. One is one line, two is two, three is three and so forth.

The default count of `assembledLines` is one for both the [abort()](/api/abort#abort) BotAction and the [createAbortLineSignal()](/api/abort#createabortlinesignal) helper.

### Optional Pipe Value
`AbortLineSignal` has an optional param called `pipeValue` that carries a `PipeValue` back to the final aborted assembler for return. 

> The optional `pipeValue` param does not get returned by a [Chain](/api/assembly-lines#chain), when it's the final signal processor.

## Infinity AbortLine Signal
It's possible to abort all lines of assembly without knowing how many there are by returning an Infinity AbortLine signal.

Infinity AbortLine signals have `assembledLines` set to `0`. When an assembler processes an Infinity AbortLine signal, it abort what it's doing and returns the same signal without modification.

## Process AbortLine Signal
 
Almost every assembler processes an AbortLine signal with the [processAbortLineSignal()](/api/abort#processabortlinesignal) helper. It supports all main use-cases of `assembledLines` 0, 1, and 2+.

This is the default aborting behavior for assemblers:

| assembledLines | effect   |
|    -   |         -       |
| 0 | Infinity AbortLine Signal aborts every BotAction and returns itself without change on each abort |
| 1 | Default AbortLine Signal aborts only one line of assembled BotActions and returns the abortLineSignal.pipeValue |
| 2+ | Level specific AbortLine Signal aborts one line of assembled BotActions at a time while reducing its assembledLines count to 1 for final abort  |

Each assembler will detect the value returned by the resolved BotAction for an AbortLine signal. If it is one, it processes it which follows the table above.

This is the default aborting behavior, and there are exceptions for some BotAction's such as the Utilities, Switch Pipe, and Pipe Case(s).

## Unique Aborting behavior
[Switch Pipe](/api/assembly-lines#switch-pipe) implements its own AbortLine signal behavior in order to support its unique functional behavior. When it hasn't received a [CasesSignal](/advanced/conditionals/#cases-signal) with its condition passed, it ignores default AbortLine signals. That's because it's intended for [abort()](/api/abort#abort) to work like `break;` from the traditional `switch(){}` code block.

Some BotAction's, like Utilities, have unique AbortLine signal behavior for aborting parts of the unique assemblers. For example, a [For All](/api/utilities#for-all) BotAction's loop iteration (running an assembled line of BotActions) can abort out of its loop iteration with a default AbortLine signal or abort the entire loop with two or more.

BotAction's unique aborting behavior are documented alongside in the API docs.
