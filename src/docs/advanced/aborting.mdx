title: Aborting
---

Botmation's Assembly Lines support the ability to stop executing a line of BotAction's, before the end of the line reaches. This is caused by an `AbortLineSignal` returned by an assembled BotAction, processed by the BotAction's Assembly Line or similar.

The AbortLineSignal has an important property called `assembledLines` which informs the Assembler how many lines of assembly to break. `assembledLines` of `1` is intended to break only one line of assembly. `2` should break the current line and the one above and so forth. There are exceptions such as `switchPipe()()`, which ignores AbortLineSignal's with `assembledLines` of `1`, when it hasn't yet received a `CasesSignal` with its condition passed. That's because `abort()` is treated like `break;` from the traditional `switch(){}` block in a `switchPipe()()`.

AbortLineSignal has an optional param called `pipeValue` that can carry a value back to the final assembler. For example, maybe in a line of BotActions, code checks the page for something and that something is missing, which the subsequent BotActions rely on. Therefore, the assembled BotAction's will fail if they run, so to prevent that, the initial BotAction can abort the assembled line by returning an AbortLineSignal.

> Any BotAction can return an AbortLineSignal, to inform its assembler BotAction to break its line. The optional `pipeValue` param is a way to signal to the assembler as to what went wrong, to log it, maybe try again with a different setup or whatever.

It's possible to break a line of assembly, then restart it with a different setup. Some BotAction's, like Utilities, have unique `AbortLineSignal` behavior that allow the breaking of various parts of a BotAction without breaking the BotAction itself, ie a [forAll()](/api/utilities#for-all) loop iteration (which runs an assembled line of BotActions for each loop iteration) can abort out of a loop iteration as one `assembledLines` and out of the entire loop with two.

Finally, AbortLineSignal supports a special case to fully abort out of all lines of assembly (terminate the bot early) by returning an `AbortLineSignal` with `assembledLines` set to `0`. It's considered an *infinite* signal, to prevent all remaining BotAction's from running.
