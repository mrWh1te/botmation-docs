## AbortLine Signal

Sometimes it's necessary to abort an assembly line(s) of BotAction's. Perhaps something is removed from a web page or a condition wasn't met that subsequent BotAction's rely on. When this happens, a BotAction returns an `AbortLineSignal`.

```typescript
type AbortLineSignal = {
  brand: 'Abort_Signal',
  assembledLines: number,
  pipeValue?: PipeValue
}
```

AbortLine signals are safely created with the [createAbortLineSignal()](/api/abort#createabortlinesignal) helper. It's a simple JSON object with potentially two to three properties.

### Assembled Lines Count

An AbortLine signal's important property is called `assembledLines`. It informs the assembler how many lines of assembly to break. One is one line, two is two, three is three and so forth.

The default count of `assembledLines` is one for both the [abort()](/api/abort#abort) BotAction and the [createAbortLineSignal()](/api/abort#createabortlinesignal) helper. It can be any positive number, including zero.

## Infinity AbortLine Signal
It's possible to abort all lines of assembly without knowing how many there are by returning an Infinity AbortLine signal.

Infinity AbortLine signals have `assembledLines` set to `0`. When an assembler processes an Infinity AbortLine signal, it aborts what it's doing and returns the same signal without change.

### Optional Pipe Value
`AbortLineSignal` has an optional param called `pipeValue` that carries a `PipeValue` back to the final aborted assembler for return. 

> The optional `pipeValue` param does not get returned by a [Chain](/api/assembly-lines#chain), when it's the final assembler to process an AbortLine signal.

## Process AbortLine Signal
 
Almost every assembler processes an AbortLine signal with the [processAbortLineSignal()](/api/abort#processabortlinesignal) helper. It supports all main use-cases of `assembledLines`: 0, 1, and 2+.

Here is a table for the default assemblers' aborting behavior:

| assembledLines | effect   |
|    -   |         -       |
| 0 | Infinity AbortLine Signal aborts every BotAction and returns itself without change on each abort |
| 1 | Default AbortLine Signal aborts only one line of assembled BotActions and returns the abortLineSignal.pipeValue |
| 2+ | Level specific AbortLine Signal aborts one line of assembled BotActions at a time while reducing its assembledLines count to 1 for final abort  |

Each assembler will detect the value returned by the resolved BotAction for an AbortLine signal. If it is one, it processes it to the effect listed above.

This is the default aborting behavior. There are exceptions for some BotAction's such as the Utilities, Switch Pipe, and Pipe Case(s), which implement their own unique aborting behavior.

## Unique Aborting behavior
[Switch Pipe](/api/assembly-lines#switch-pipe) implements its own AbortLine signal behavior in order to support its own unique functionality. When it hasn't received a [CasesSignal](/advanced/conditionals/#cases-signal) with its condition passed, it ignores default AbortLine signals. That's because [abort()](/api/abort#abort) is treated like `break;` from the traditional `switch(){}` code block, inside a [Switch Pipe](/api/assembly-lines#switch-pipe).

Some BotAction's, like Utilities, have unique AbortLine signal behavior for aborting parts of the unique assemblers. For example, a [For All](/api/utilities#for-all) BotAction's loop iteration (runs an assembled line of BotActions) can abort out of its loop iteration with a default AbortLine signal or abort the entire loop with two or more `assembledLines`.

BotAction's with unique aborting behavior have their aborting functionality explained in their documentation, listed under API in the sidebar.
