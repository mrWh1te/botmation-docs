What if you want to run an assembly line of actions, but only after finding something in the Page to be true? Botmation has you covered with a special type of BotAction called Utilities.

Let's get started with the simplest one, called `givenThat()()`, a functional if statement.

Here's a simplified bit of code from the Instagram example that attempts to login, only, *if* the Bot is a Guest:

```typescript
await chain(
    // "Console" BotAction
    log('Bot is running aka User'),

    // "Utility" BotAction givenThat() 
    //    Resolves a "Conditional" BotAction for a boolean value
    //    Only if that value equals TRUE, then the actions assembled are ran
    givenThat(isGuest)(
        log('is guest so logging in'),
        login({username: 'account', password: 'password'}),
    ),

    givenThat(isLoggedIn)(
        log('Bot is logged in')
    )
)(page)
```

`givenThat()` accepts a special kind of BotAction called `ConditionalBotAction`. Therefore, `isGuest` and `isLoggedIn` are actually BotAction's with stricter typing that returns a boolean value. If the value returned is `true`, then the assembled actions are ran in a Pipe.

So what happens is that `givenThat()` resolves the `ConditionalBotAction` which can be a complex composition of actions to determine something, in this case whether or not the Bot is logged in.
