Botmation has a special type of BotAction called Utilities. These allow you to build lines of BotAction's but with unique behavior.

## Functional if statement

Let's get started with the simplest one, called `givenThat()()`, a functional if statement.

Here's a simplified bit of code from the [Instagram example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/tree/master/src/examples/instagram.ts) that attempts to login, only if the bot is a Guest:

```typescript
await chain(
    log('Bot is running aka User'),

    givenThat(isGuest)(
        log('is guest so logging in'),
        login({username: 'account', password: 'password'}),
    ),

    givenThat(isLoggedIn)(
        log('Bot is logged in'),
        screenshot('logged-in-view')
    )
)(page)
```

`givenThat()()` returns a composed BotAction that runs assembled BotAction's only if the BotAction in the first call `givenThat()` resolves `true`.

> All [Utility BotAction's](/api/utilities) run assembled BotAction's in a Pipe

## Conditional BotAction

The first call `givenThat()` accepts a special kind of BotAction called ConditionalBotAction. ConditionalBotAction are like BotAction's, except they *always* return a boolean value.

`isGuest` and `isLoggedIn` are ConditionalBotAction's for Instagram's web app. They are not intended to change the state of the `page` but check the `page` for a condition, then report on it. This way, the Instagram `login()` BotAction is ran only if needed. Check the [Instagram example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/tree/master/src/examples/instagram.ts) for more like saving & loading cookies, to skip subsequent logins.

For a more technical explanation, `givenThat()()` returns a customized BotAction for the whole flow. When you resolve the returned BotAction, it runs through a series of steps. First, it resolves the `ConditionalBotAction` in a Pipe for the value it returns. Then runs the assembled BotAction's if the value was `true`.
