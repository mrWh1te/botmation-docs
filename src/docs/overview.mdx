Botmation is a simple, declarative framework to build bots with *composable* functions called BotActions.

BotActions are self-reliant, single-purposed, async functions that perform tasks from simple, such as "click this button", to broad complex flows, such as "scrape this feed and like all of my friends' posts". They are ran individually or assembled together in a new BotAction.

> BotActions are like bricks. Bricks build walls, walls build buildings, buildings build cities and so forth. Except, at each level of composition (brick, wall, building, etc), they are *all* the same *type* of function, a BotAction. Regardless of their compositional complexity, they are all single async functions called BotActions.

Imagine a door üö™ into a coffee shop ‚òï where customers üßç,üßç,üßç enter. As they step inside, a customer line forms üßçüßçüßç. The first customer served, is the first customer in line, then the following, and so forth.

Botmation's bots are *assembled in lines* of BotActions. Assembled bots run their actions in the order declared, from first to last.

A single BotAction can be an assembled line of other BotActions. Therefore, a single person üßç in the coffee shop ‚òï, can actually be a whole other line of people üßçüßçüßç. Then any one of those people üßç in this "sub" line üßçüßçüßç, can be a whole other line of people üßçüßçüßç infinitely deep ‚ôæÔ∏èüêá.

The possibilities are endless!

> If you're familiar with de-coupling functionality, this compositional pattern creates structure for your code to keep all units of functionality separate, pluggable and 100% reusable.

## Running BotActions

BotActions wrap a Puppeteer [Page](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&show=api-class-page) instance as a function param. They are completed once their returned promise resolves.

Some BotActions have higher-order functions that customize their functionality. For example, the BotAction [goTo()](/api/navigation/#go-to) uses a higher-order function to set the URL for the bot to navigate too, while [waitForNavigation](/api/navigation/#wait-for-navigation) does not:
```typescript
const page = await browser.newPage() // Puppeteer Browser

await goTo('https://example.com')(page) // call higher-order to get the BotAction
await waitForNavigation(page) // no higher-order, just resolve the BotAction
```

> [Higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) are functions that return a function. Botmation uses higher-order functions to customize BotActions during runtime.

So how is this better than using Puppeteer directly? BotActions can be assembled into new reusable functions, of varying compositional complexity. No matter what, regardless of their complexity, they are *just* single async functions.

## Assembling Bots

Bots are built by assembling BotActions, declaratively, in a line. This makes each bot's code highly readable.

Let's edit the code from the example above, by assembling it into a reusable bot via a special kind of BotAction, an [Assembly Line](/api/assembly-lines). The simplest is called [chain()()](/api/assembly-lines#chain):

```typescript
const bot = chain(
  goTo('https://example.com'),
  waitForNavigation
)
```

This BotAction [chains](/api/assembly-lines#chain) BotActions together in a new reusable BotAction.

> This technique is inspired by [Currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) from Functional Programming.

Now let's run the bot:
```typescript
const bot = chain(
  goTo('https://example.com'),
  waitForNavigation
)

const page = await browser.newPage()
await bot(page)
```

This bot function can be reused on multiple Puppeteer pages. We can even run multiple bots [concurrently](/topic/concurrency), using the same code.

> An assembled bot is still a BotAction. But, a BotAction is a bot part. Philosophically speaking, parts and bots are differentiated via observation. BotActions are bot parts, until they are ran as a bot, either individually or in an assembled composition.

So how do we create our own BotActions that go beyond the functionality provided by Botmation?

## Simple BotActions

There's three main ways to make your own BotActions, from simple to complex.

> Every BotAction receives a Puppeteer `page` as its first param

The simplest are plain async functions. Here's the code for the [waitForNavigation](/api/navigation/#wait-for-navigation) BotAction:

```typescript
const waitForNavigation: BotAction = async(page) => {
  await page.waitForNavigation()
}
```

This BotAction calls the `page` [waitForNavigation](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&show=api-pagewaitfornavigationoptions) function. Simplicity is great.

> You can call any Puppeteer page function inside a BotAction. However, you're not limited too just Puppeteer. You can [inject](/topic/injects) other libraries into your bots, which helps with writing tests for your BotActions, as they can easily be mocked.

## Dynamic BotActions

BotActions wrapped in a higher-order functions are dynamic. Let's look at the code for the [goTo()](/api/navigation/#go-to) BotAction that navigates the page to the URL provided:

```typescript
const goTo = (url: string, goToOptions?: Partial<WaitForOptions>): BotAction =>
  async(page) => {
    if (page.url() === url) {
      return
    }

    await page.goto(url, enrichGoToPageOptions(goToOptions))
  }
```

The higher-order synchronous function returns the customized BotAction function during runtime. Here [goTo()](/api/navigation/#go-to) uses a higher-order function to dynamically set the `url` and `goToOptions?` for the BotAction.

Higher order function parameters can be whatever you need them to be. They're typed as a spread array of `any`, so add more if you need more. Also, you are not limited to one higher-order sync function. Stack them up, as high as need be! The possibilities are endless.

> Feeling curious about stacked higher-order functions? Check out the [Loops BotActions](/api/loops) for practical BotActions that wrap themselves with two higher order functions.

Dynamic BotActions can be reused to create static, more readable BotActions:
```typescript
const goToGoogle = goTo('https://google.com')
```

## Composed BotActions

However, the best has been saved for last! The technique for assembling bots is the same way for assembling complex BotActions. Remember, they are all BotActions until ran. For example, here is a composed BotAction that logs a bot into a website through a Login form:

```typescript
const login = (username: string, password: string): BotAction =>
  chain(
    goTo('https://example.com/login.html'),
    click('form input[name="username"]'),
    type(username),
    click('form input[name="password"]'),
    type(password),
    click('form button[type="submit"]'),
    waitForNavigation,
    log('Login Complete')
  )
```

`login()` is a higher-order sync function that returns an assembled line of BotActions using the [Chain](/api/assembly-lines#chain) BotAction.

This BotAction completes a login flow for an example website form. Once started, it runs the assembled BotActions, one at a time, in the line they are declared. First, it navigates to the login page, then enters the `username` and `password` into the login page's form's inputs, submits the form, waits for the Navigation of the page to complete, before finally logging `Login Complete` in the NodeJS console, but you already know that from reading the code!

> Assembly Lines are not the only kind of BotAction that assembles other BotActions. For more complex situations, check out [Branching](/api/branching) & [Loop](/api/loops) BotActions for unique ways to assemble BotActions i.e. [if statement](/api/branching#given-that).
