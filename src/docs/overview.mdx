This library consists of functions from two categories: *BotAction* & *Helper*. BotActions are async functions that handle various tasks in the web. Helper functions reduce boilerplate code in making BotAction's. BotAction's are composed, assembled, and ran by BotAction's.

The premise of Botmation is building bots with reusable components called BotAction's. This library gives you some to help you get started, and gives you Helper functions to help you make your own, while composing complex ones made of actions from both this library and your own! 

The possibilities are endless.
