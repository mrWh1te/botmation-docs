There are [Utility BotAction's](/api/utilities) dedicated to running lines of BotAction's in loops.

## For All

[forAll()()()](/api/utilities#for-all) is a BotAction that iterates a collection (an array or an object with key-value pairs) provided in the first call `firstAll()` with the callback function provided in the second call `firstAll()()`. The callback function returns a BotAction or an array of BotAction's to run on each loop iteration.

Let's see an example:
```typescript
await chain(
    forAll(['google', 'facebook'])(
        (siteDomain) => ([ // name the var whatever desired in the closure
            goTo('http://' + siteDomain + '.com'),
            screenshot(siteDomain + '-homepage')
        ])
    )
)(page)
```
Here we pass in a collection of site domain's in the first call of `forAll()` then in the second call pass in a callback function, to run BotAction(s) on each iteration of the collection. Therefore, the BotAction's returned by the callback function, in the second call, are ran in a loop for each item of the iteration, in this case, each domain name.

When the [forAll()()()](/api/utilities#for-all) BotAction completes, it will have visited and taken screenshots of each site in the array.

Learn more about `forAll()()` by reading its [documentation](/api/utilities#for-all).

## For As Long

[forAsLong()()()](/api/utilities#for-as-long) is a BotAction that works like a functional while loop. It resolves the [ConditionalBotAction](/topic/conditionals#conditional-botaction) before running each loop iteration. If it does *not* resolve `true`, then it stops.

With this you could write a dynamic BotAction that handles multiple items on a page, when you're not sure how many there are. For example, in looping through the content posted in a social media feed, news feed, etc.

Here is a concept:
```typescript
await chain(
    // imaginary BotAction's: notAtEndOfNewsFeed & scrollToNextNewsFeedItem
    forAsLong(notAtEndOfNewsFeed)(
        screenshot(siteDomain + '-homepage'),
        scrollToNextNewsFeedItem
    )
)(page)
```

## Do While

[doWhile()()()](/api/utilities#do-while) is a BotAction that works like a functional do while loop. It first runs the assembled BotAction's of the second call. Then begins a loop of running the assembled BotAction's if the [ConditionalBotAction](/topic/conditionals#conditional-botaction) passed in the first call resolves `true` before each loop iteration.

One use-case for this BotAction is "liking" posts in a social media feed. The BotAction first likes the post in the window, then scrolls down a bit. Then in a loop, likes each post while it scrolls down to the bottom of the feed, exiting the loop once the end of the page is found. So with `doWhile()()` you would write a [ConditionalBotAction](/topic/conditionals#conditional-botaction) that checks for the end of the feed, to exit your looped BotAction's. This can be done with `forAsLong()()` too.

Here is a concept:
```typescript
await chain(
    // imaginary BotAction's for navigating a social media feed
    doWhile(notAtEndOfSocialFeed)(
        givenThat(postInWindowBelongsToFriend)(
            likePostInWindow()
        ),
        scrollWindowToNextPost
    )
)(page)
```
