title: Injects

Botmation's pattern of composing BotAction's has support for injecting other dependencies to help complete various tasks. 

> Injecting dependencies is a good pattern for Unit-Testing as they can be mocked easily

## BotAction Interface

Let's take a look at the actual BotAction Function interface:
```typescript
interface BotAction<R = void|AbortLineSignal, I extends Array<any> = any[]> extends Function {
  (page: Page, ...injects: I) : Promise<R>
}
```

See, there is a second param, after `page` called `injects` which, by default, is a spread array of `any`. It's optional, you don't have to use it. But, it's useful. All Assembly Lines supports the `injects` system.

If many BotAction's in a line need an object(s), value(s), service(s), etc. then inject them. Let's see how:

```typescript
const service = new ServiceA()
const todaysDate = new Date()

await chain(
    // ... actions
)(page, service, todaysDate)
```

The assembled BotAction's in the `chain()` will be called with `service` and `todaysDate` as the second and third parameters.

## Inject()() BotAction

Now, what if you want to compose a line of actions, but with new injects? You can use the `inject()()` BotAction to pass in new injects. The higher level injects will be appended to the new ones.

A few BotAction's are composed with `inject()()` such as `files()()` and `indexedDBStore()()`. Those composed BotAction's inject specific `injects` from the first `inject()` call, and append the other injects from the higher context, for the assembled BotAction's.

Here's an example:
```typescript
const generalService = new GeneralService()
const specialService = new SpecialService()

await chain(
    inject(specialService)(
        goTo('http://example.com/special-page.html'),
        doSomethingSpecial()
        // these actions have `specialService` as their 1st inject
        // and `generalService` as their 2nd inject
    ),
    log('some message') // this log() BotAction will NOT have `specialService` injected
                        // but, will still have `generalService` as its 1st inject
)(page, generalService)
```
This gives granular control of what's passed in the spreaded `injects` array for assembled BotAction's in various scopes.
