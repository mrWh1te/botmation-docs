## AbortLine Signal

Sometimes it's necessary to abort an assembled line of BotActions. Perhaps the bot detects that a required  button, to complete its task, is missing from the web page. Therefore, instead of letting the subsequent BotActions run and fail, from trying to click a button that doesn't exist, a BotAction can instead return an `AbortLineSignal`.

```typescript
type AbortLineSignal = {
  brand: 'Abort_Signal',
  assembledLines: number,
  pipeValue?: PipeValue
}
```

AbortLine signals are created with the [createAbortLineSignal()](/api/abort#createabortlinesignal) helper. As seen above, it's a simple JSON object with two to three properties.

### Assembled Lines Count

The most important property of an AbortLine Signal is called `assembledLines`. It informs the higher-order assembler, how many assembled lines of BotActions, the signal should break.

When as assembler processes an AbortLine Signal, with a positive `assembledLines` count, it breaks its sub-line, then decreases the count by 1 before returning the signal for the next assembler to process.

The default count of `assembledLines` is one for both the [abort()](/api/abort#abort) BotAction and the [createAbortLineSignal()](/api/abort#createabortlinesignal) helper. It can be any positive number, including zero.

### Infinity AbortLine Signal
It's possible to abort all lines of assembly without knowing how many there are by returning an Infinity AbortLine Signal.

Infinity AbortLines have `assembledLines` set to `0`. When an assembler processes an Infinity AbortLine signal, it aborts what it's doing and returns the same signal without decreasing the `assembledLines` count.

### Optional Pipe Value
`AbortLineSignal` has an optional param called `pipeValue` that carries a `PipeValue` back to the final aborted assembler for return.

> The optional `pipeValue` param does not get returned by [Chain](/api/assembly-lines#chain), when it's the final assembler to process an AbortLine signal, because chains don't deal with pipe values. Use [Pipe](/api/assembly-lines#pipe) instead.

## Process AbortLine Signal

Almost every assembler processes an AbortLine signal with the [processAbortLineSignal()](/api/abort#processabortlinesignal) helper. It supports all main use-cases of `assembledLines`: 0, 1, and 2+.

Here is a table for the default assemblers' aborting behavior:

| assembledLines | effect   |
|    -   |         -       |
| 0 | Infinity AbortLine Signal aborts every BotAction and returns itself without change on each abort |
| 1 | Default AbortLine Signal aborts only one line of assembled BotActions and returns the abortLineSignal.pipeValue |
| 2+ | Level specific AbortLine Signal aborts one line of assembled BotActions at a time, for each count of `assembledLines`  |

Each assembler will detect the value returned by the resolved BotAction for an AbortLine Signal. If it is an AbortLine Signal, it processes it to the effect listed above.

There are exceptions for some BotActions such as the [Loops](/api/loops), [Branching](/api/branching), [Switch Pipe](/api/assembly-lines#switch-pipe) and [Pipe Case(s)](/api/pipe#pipe-case). They implement slightly different behavior, to match their unique functionality to offer developers more control.

## Unique Aborting behavior
[Switch Pipe](/api/assembly-lines#switch-pipe) was created to supply a switch/case/break flow in Botmation. To accomplish that, it implements its own AbortLine Signal behavior, which treats the [Abort](/api/abort#abort) BotAction like a `break;` statement in a [switch case](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp). When a Switch Pipe processes its assembled BotActions, and hasn't received a [CasesSignal](/topic/conditionals/#cases-signal) with its condition passed, it swallows up AbortLine Signals with one `assembledLines`, effectively ignoring them. By assembling [Pipe Case(s)](/api/pipe#pipe-case) BotActions whose conditions pass, the Switch Pipe will STOP ignoring Abort BotActions. Therefore, mimicing the switch/case/break flow functionally. Here's an [example](/sites/linkedin#like-user-posts-from). Once a `pipeCase` or `pipeCases` matches, the next `abort()` statement will stop remaining assembled BotActions from running.

The [For All](/api/loops#for-all) BotAction can have any loop iteration aborted without aborting the loop itself. A default AbortLine Signal will abort one loop iteration, while AbortLine Signals with `assembledLines` two or more will abort the entire loop.

All BotActions with unique aborting behavior have their aborting functionality explained in their respective documentation pages.
