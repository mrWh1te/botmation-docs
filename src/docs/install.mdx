Botmation is a NodeJS library written in TypeScript. You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) LTS installed and the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) installed globally (or have a transpiling code step).

## Install

Install Botmation with `npm` and save it as a dependency:

```bash
npm i -s botmation
```

If you're just getting started, install `puppeteer` latest v2 & `@types/puppeteer` v3.0.0:

```bash
npm install -s puppeteer@">=2.0.0 <3.0.0" @types/puppeteer@3.0.0
```

While `Botmation` source code works with Puppeteer version 3, 4, and 5, the E2E testing has a bug that is limiting the packaging, as of this moment.

> If you want to use Botmation with the latest Puppeteer version, for now, clone the repo locally and work from the playground bot. From there you can install the latest `@types/puppeteer` and `puppeteer` packages then build Botmation source code with it. But, be wary, the E2E tests will become rather unstable.

Then import any function, BotAction and Helper, from the `botmation` module:
```typescript
import { chain, goTo, screenshot } from 'botmation';
```

As a reference, there are 12 groups of BotAction's, as of v2.0.0. Each one is listed in the sidebar under BotAction.

After that, you are ready ðŸš€
