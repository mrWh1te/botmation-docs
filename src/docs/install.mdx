title: 'Install'
---

Botmation is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and runs on [NodeJS v10+](http://nodejs.org/). You'll need both installed to compile and run the code.

## Bare bones setup

If you're starting a blank new project, from your project's code directory, use `npm` from NodeJS and `tsc` from TypeScript, to initialize the environment:
```bash
npm init -y
tsc --init
touch index.ts
```

Now you can begin writing your bot code in `index.ts` file.

## Install Botmation

For any bot work, you'll need at least the core Botmation package. Install via `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save @botmation/core
```

## Install Puppeteer

If you haven't already, install [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/):

```bash
npm install --save puppeteer
```

## Import BotActions

Import BotActions, helpers, etc from the `@botmation/core` package:
```typescript
import { chain, goTo, screenshot } from '@botmation/core';
```

All of Core's functions are documented with examples, under Core in the sidebar on the left.

> Helpers are plain functions to reduce boilerplate. They are not BotActions. They are documented in their respective API pages.

## Compile and run

If you're following the [Bare bones setup](#bare-bones-setup), compile and run the code:
```bash
tsc # compile
node index.js # run
```

> If you want to watch Puppeteer control the browser, configure it with `headless: false`. Otherwise, the browser window won't display when the bot runs.

Have fun ðŸš€
