title: 'Install'

Botmation uses [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). You'll need [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) & [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) LTS installed to compile and run the code, respectively.

## New project setup

If you're just getting started, but have `npm` (installed NodeJS) and `tsc` (installed TypeScript), here is a bare minimum setup to get going fast. From a terminal, create a folder for the source code and `cd` into it, then use the CLI tools above to initialize the environment:
```
$ npm init -y
$ tsc --init
$ touch index.ts
```
Then you're ready to code! Get started faster with [example code](/examples).

## Install Botmation

Install Botmation with `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save botmation
```

## Install Puppeteer with types

If you haven't already, install `puppeteer` with its TypeScript types `@types/puppeteer`:

```bash
npm install --save puppeteer 
npm install --save-dev @types/puppeteer
```

## Import BotAction's & more

Then in code, import any Botmation function from the `botmation` module:
```typescript
import { chain, goTo, screenshot } from 'botmation';
```

Each one is documented with their actual code and usage examples in this site's main navigation under API.

## Compile and run

If you're following the [New project setup](#new-project-setup), compile and run the code:
```
$ tsc && node index.js
```

Remember to configure Puppeteer with `headless: false` if you want to watch the bot in action! Otherwise, the browser won't show-up in screen.

Have fun ðŸš€
