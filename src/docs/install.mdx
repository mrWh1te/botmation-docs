Botmation is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and runs on [NodeJS v10+](http://nodejs.org/). You'll need both installed to compile and run the code.

## New project setup

From a terminal, in your project's code directory, use `npm` from NodeJS and `tsc` from TypeScript, to initialize the environment:
```bash
npm init -y
tsc --init
touch index.ts
```

Now you can get started with writing your bot code in the `index.ts` file.

## Install Botmation

For any bot work, you'll need at least the core Botmation package, installed via `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save @botmation/core
```

## Install Puppeteer

If you haven't already, install `puppeteer`:

```bash
npm install --save puppeteer
```

## Import BotActions

Then in your code, import the Botmations, helpers, etc from the `@botmation/core` package:
```typescript
import { chain, goTo, screenshot } from '@botmation/core';
```

All BotActions are documented, with their code and usage examples, under API in the sidebar on the left.

## Compile and run

If you're following the [New project setup](#new-project-setup), compile and run the code:
```bash
tsc # compiles
node index.js # runs
```

> If you want to watch Puppeteer control the browser, configure it with `headless: false`. Otherwise, the browser window won't display when the bot runs.

Have fun ðŸš€
