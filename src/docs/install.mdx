title: 'Install'
---

Botmation uses [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). You'll need [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) LTS and [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) installed to build the JavaScript code.

## Install Botmation

Install Botmation with `npm` and save it as a dependency:

```bash
npm install --save botmation
```

## Install Puppeteer with types

If you're just getting started, install `puppeteer` latest v2 & `@types/puppeteer` v3.0.0:

```bash
npm install --save puppeteer@">=2.0.0 <3.0.0" @types/puppeteer@3.0.0
```

The `@types/puppeteer` package provides typing in TypeScript for Puppeteer.

Botmation source code works with Puppeteer version 3, 4, and 5, but the E2E testing has a bug that is limiting the packaging, as of this moment.

> If you want to use Botmation with the latest Puppeteer version, for now, clone the repo locally and work from the [Playground](playground). From there you can install the latest `@types/puppeteer` and `puppeteer` packages then build Botmation source code with them. But, be wary, the E2E tests are unstable at scale.

## Import BotAction's & more

Then import any function, BotAction, Helper, and Instagram specific from the `botmation` module:
```typescript
import { chain, goTo, screenshot } from 'botmation';
```

Each one is documented with code and examples in the sidebar under API.

After that, you are ready ðŸš€
