title: 'Install'

Botmation is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and runs on [NodeJS v10+](http://nodejs.org/). You'll need both installed to compile and run the code.

## Bare bones setup

If you're starting a new project, in your project's code directory, use `npm` from NodeJS and `tsc` from TypeScript, to initialize the environment:
```bash
npm init -y
tsc --init
touch index.ts
```

Now you can begin writing bot code in `index.ts` file and more.

## Install Botmation

For any bot work, you'll need at least the core Botmation package, installed via `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save @botmation/core
```

## Install Puppeteer

If you haven't already, install puppeteer:

```bash
npm install --save puppeteer
```

## Import BotActions

Then in your code, import the Botmations, helpers, etc from the `@botmation/core` package:
```typescript
import { chain, goTo, screenshot } from '@botmation/core';
```

All of Core's functions are documented, with their code and usage examples, under API in the sidebar on the left. All site specific functions that are available in separate site specific packages are listed under Sites, in the sidebar on the left.

## Compile and run

If you're following the [New project setup](#new-project-setup), compile and run the code:
```bash
tsc # compiles
node index.js # runs
```

> If you want to watch Puppeteer control the browser, configure it with `headless: false`. Otherwise, the browser window won't display when the bot runs.

Have fun ðŸš€
