In the `./src/examples` [directory](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/tree/master/src/examples) of Botmation's repo, exists a small collection of example bots, pre-built, to help you get started:

## Object-Oriented Bot
Classes are great for encapsulating functionality. It's possible to use Botmation to compose instance functions that operate on the bot's `page`. Here's an example:

```typescript
class ExampleSiteBot {
  private page: Puppeteer.Page;

  constructor(page: Puppeteer.Page) {
    this.page = page;
  }

  public async login() {
    await chain(
      goTo('http://example.com/login.html'),
      click('form input[name="username"]'),
      type(username),
      click('form input[name="password"]'),
      type(password),
      click('form button[type="submit"]'),
      waitForNavigation,
      log('Login Complete')
    )(this.page);
  }

  public async takeAPhoto(fileName: string) {
    await screenshot(fileName)(this.page);
  }
}
```

We can create an instance of this class and `await` the `login()` method then `await` the `takeAPhoto()` as needed.

Here is an [object-oriented example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/tree/master/src/examples/simple_objectoriented.ts), where the class provides a composable `actions()` method and supports [Injects](advanced/injecting).

## Functional Bot
Functional is lean and reduces barriers in reusing code. Here is a [simple functional example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/tree/master/src/examples/simple_functional.ts) that takes a screenshot:

```typescript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false});
const page = await browser.newPage();

// Run the chain of actions
await chain(
  log('Bot running'),
  goTo('https://google.com'),
  screenshot('google-homepage-screenshot'),
  log('Screenshot taken')
)(page);
```

## Screenshots Bot
This [screenshots example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/tree/master/src/examples/screenshots.ts) demonstrates the power of Puppeteer in the ease of generating PNG screenshots, when combined with Botmation, in a composable way, to reduce the amount of code you write in generating screenshots of many websites. It uses an Utility BotAction called [forAll()()](/api/utilities#for-all), let's see it in action:

```typescript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false});
const page = await browser.newPage();

const newsSites = [
  'timesofindia.indiatimes.com'
  'cnn.com',
  'forbes.com',
  'global.chinadaily.com.cn',
  'nytimes.com',
  'wsj.com',
  'foxnews.com',
];

await chain(
  log('Botmation running'),

  // forAll() iterates a collection ie array
  forAll(newsSites)(
    // forAll()() accepts a callback function to call on each iteration
    (siteName) => ([
      // 1) The bot visits the site
      goTo('https://' + siteName, {waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'}),
      // 2) The bot saves a screenshot as a PNG locally with the filename provided:
      screenshot('news-' + siteName)
    ])
  ),

  log('Done taking screenshots'),
)(page);
```

## Instagram Bot

This [Instagram example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/tree/master/src/examples/instagram.ts) uses an Utility BotAction called [givenThat()()](/api/utilities#given-that) as a functional if statement to check the authentication status of the bot.

Let's look at a simplified version:

```typescript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false});
const page = await browser.newPage();

await chain(
  log('Botmation running'),

  goTo(getInstagramBaseUrl()),
  
  // lets log in, if we are a guest
  givenThat(isGuest) (
    log('is guest so logging in'),
    login({username: 'account', password: 'password'}), // <- put your username and password here
  ),

  // in case that log in failed, lets check before we operate as a logged in user
  givenThat(isLoggedIn)(
    log('is logged in'),

    screenshot('logged-in')
  ),

  log('Instagram Bot Done')
)(page);
```

`isGuest` and `isLoggedIn` are a special kind of BotAction called ConditionalBotAction. These two, and `login()` are part of the `Botmation` npm package that can be imported for you to use and are specific for Instagram's web app.

> It's currently planned to support Instagram's auth BotAction's inside the Botmation npm package until major v3.0.0. Soon, to be released as a separate new npm package ie `botmation-instagram` will provide the same BotAction's. There will be separate npm packages for each collection of BotAction's focused on a particular website ie Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.

ConditionalBotAction's return a Promise that resolves a boolean value. `givenThat()()()` runs the ConditionalBotAction and waits for the value to resolve. If the value resolves `true`, then it runs the assembled BotAction's.

Therefore, the console will log `is guest so logging in` only if the `isGuest` BotAction resolves `true` and similar for `is logged in`.
