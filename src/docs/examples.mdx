In the `./src/examples` [directory](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/tree/master/src/examples) of Botmation's repo, exists a small collection of example bots, pre-built, to help you get started:

## Object-Oriented Bot
Classes are great for encapsulating functionality. It's possible to use Botmation to compose instance functions that operate on the bot's `page`.

## Functional Bot
Functional is lean and reduces barriers in reusing code.

## Screenshots Bot
This example demonstrates the power of Puppeteer in the ease of generating PNG screenshots, but with Botmation, in a composed way.

## Instagram Bot
This example is the driving force behind Botmation's design as a means for composing bots to automate social media in pursuit of consuming less, while supporting friends and family more.

This example uses an advanced Utility BotAction called [givenThat()()](api/utilities#given-that), which is in essence a functional if statement. It is used to check the authentication status of the bot, before attempting to login or take a screenshot of the home page, as a logged in user.
