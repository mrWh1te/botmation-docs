Botmation is a NodeJS library written in TypeScript. You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) LTS installed and the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) installed globally (or have a transpiling code step).

## Install

Install Botmation with `npm` and save it as a dependency:

```bash
npm i -s botmation
```

If you're just getting started, install `puppeteer` latest v2 & `@types/puppeteer` v3.0.0:

```bash
npm install -s puppeteer@">=2.0.0 <3.0.0" @types/puppeteer@3.0.0
```

While `Botmation` source code works with Puppeteer version 3, 4, and 5, the E2E testing has a bug that is limiting the packaging, as of this moment.

> If you want to use Botmation with the latest Puppeteer version, for now, clone the repo locally and work from the playground bot. From there you can install the latest `@types/puppeteer` and `puppeteer` packages then build Botmation source code with it. But, be wary, the E2E tests will become rather unstable.

Then import any function, BotAction and Helper, from the `botmation` module:
```typescript
import { chain, goTo, screenshot } from 'botmation';
```

As a reference, there are 12 groups of BotAction's, as of v2.0.0. Each one is listed in the sidebar under BotAction.

After that, you are ready ðŸš€

## Examples

In the `./src/examples` [directory](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/tree/master/src/examples) of Botmation's repo, exists a small collection of simple bots, to help you get started:

- [Getting Started: Object-Oriented](/src/examples/simple_objectoriented.ts)
- [Getting Started: Functional](/src/examples/simple_functional.ts)
- [Taking Screenshots](/src/examples/screenshots.ts)
- [Logging into Instagram](/src/examples/instagram.ts)

You can copy/paste the code or setup Botmation's repo locally to run the Bots from there.

## Playground Bot

If you just want to play with this project without setting one up yourself, the quickest way is to:

1) Clone this repo locally
```bash
git clone git@github.com:mrWh1te/Botmation.git
cd Botmation
```

2) Install the npm dependencies while ignoring scripts: 
```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
```
3) Rebuild the Puppeteer dependency (run its scripts): 
```bash
npm rebuild puppeteer
```

4) Edit the Playground Bot's source code: `./src/playground_bot.ts`

5) After each playground change, build the project code: 
```bash
npm run build
```

6) Run the built playground bot: 
```bash
npm run playground
```

You can also edit and run each example with their own command:
```bash
npm run examples/simple_objectoriented
npm run examples/simple_functional
npm run examples/instagram
npm run examples/screenshots
npm run examples/pdf
```

Have fun!
