These BotAction's focus on logging into LinkedIn with an account then processing the account's Feed. From logging in, to liking feed posts, it's a small collection to help get started. 

> These functions are to be published in their own npm package, but for now, you're welcome to copy and paste them into your own code.

## Overview

The current set of BotAction's are for logging in and liking posts in the feed. Here is a working [example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/master/src/examples/linkedin.ts) of them in use.

## Navigation 
Simple functions for navigating to various parts of the LinkedIn web app.

### goHome
```typescript
const goHome: BotAction = 
  goTo('https://www.linkedin.com/', {waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'})
```

### goToFeed
```typescript
const goToFeed: BotAction = 
  goTo('https://www.linkedin.com/feed/', {waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'})
```

### goToMessaging
```typescript
const goToMessaging: BotAction = 
  goTo('https://www.linkedin.com/messaging/', {waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'})
```

### goToNotifications
```typescript
const goToNotifications: BotAction = 
  goTo('https://www.linkedin.com/notifications/', {waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'})
```

## Auth

These BotAction's focus on logging into the LinkedIn web app.

### login()
```typescript
const login = (emailOrPhone: string, password: string): BotAction =>
  chain(
    errors('LinkedIn login()')(
      goTo('https://www.linkedin.com/login'),
      click('form input[id="username"]'),
      type(emailOrPhone),
      click('form input[id="password"]'),
      type(password),
      click('form button[type="submit"]'),
      waitForNavigation,
      log('LinkedIn Login Complete')
    )
  )
```
This BotAction is a composition that uses [errors()()](/api/errors#errors) to wrap the main assembled BotAction's, in case something goes wrong here (ie a selector is updated so `click()` fails), dev's will have an easier time debugging when errors are thrown here.

The composition is declarative, therefore needs little explaining. `login()` is a higher-order function that takes a `emailOrPhone` and `password` strings to automatically perform the login flow in the web app.

### isGuest
```typescript
const isGuest: ConditionalBotAction = pipe()(
  // data feature for user notifications
  getLocalStorageItem('voyager-web:badges'),
  map(value => value === null) // Local Storage returns null if not found
)
```
After some investigating, it appears that Local Storage is used to maintain the state of the application's features, where each key is a major app feature. The particular key here references, what appears to be, a "Notifications" feature which is global to the app (in the Layout) and belongs only to Users.

### isLoggedIn
```typescript
const isLoggedIn: ConditionalBotAction = pipe()(
  // data feature for user notifications
  getLocalStorageItem('voyager-web:badges'),
  map(value => typeof value === 'string') // Local Storage returns string value if found
)
```

## Feed
These BotAction's focus on operating in the main Feed of LinkedIn's web app.

### Scrape Feed Post
This BotAction takes a specific post html attribute `data-id` value to scrape it with the provided HTML parser.

```typescript
const scrapeFeedPost = (postDataId: string): BotAction<CheerioStatic> =>
  $('.application-outlet .feed-outlet [role="main"] [data-id="'+ postDataId + '"]')
```

### If Post Not Loaded Cause Loading Then Scrape
Linkedin's feed lazily loads the content of its offscreen posts. It uses div containers, each with their own `data-id` attribute, as placeholders for the content to be loaded in. This BotAction tests to see if a particular scraped post was fully loaded and if not, it causes the app to load it by scrolling to it. Then it scrapes the fully loaded container.

```typescript
const ifPostNotLoadedCauseLoadingThenScrape = (post: CheerioStatic): BotAction<CheerioStatic> =>
  pipe(post)(
    errors('LinkedIn causeLazyLoadingThenScrapePost()')(
      pipeCase(postHasntFullyLoadedYet)(
        scrollTo('.application-outlet .feed-outlet [role="main"] [data-id="'+ post('[data-id]').attr('data-id') + '"]'),
        scrapeFeedPost(post('[data-id]').attr('data-id') + '')
      ),
      map(casesSignalToPipeValue)
    )
  )
```

### Like User Post
It takes a scraped feed post, to grab identifying information for the "Like" button. It will throw and catch an error if the "Like" button was already liked, given how Puppeteer's `page.click()` handles elements not found. A "liked" button has a slightly different selector.

```typescript
const likeUserPost = (post: CheerioStatic): BotAction =>
  errors('LinkedIn like() - Could not Like Post: Either already Liked or button not found')(
    click( 'div[data-id="' + post('div[data-id]').attr('data-id') + '"] button[aria-label="Like ' + post(feedPostAuthorSelector).text() + 'â€™s post"]')
  )
```

### Like User Posts From
It takes a spread array of strings of the exact names of people, to like their posts in the feed. The function itself goes beyond the required scope, but to serve as a decent starting point for more complex feed interactions.

```typescript
const likeUserPostsFrom = (...peopleNames: string[]): BotAction => 
  pipe()(
    scrapeFeedPosts,
    forAll()(
      post => pipe(post)(
        ifPostNotLoadedCauseLoadingThenScrape(post),
        switchPipe()(
          pipeCase(postIsPromotion)(
            map((promotionPost: CheerioStatic) => promotionPost('[data-id]').attr('data-id')),
            log('Promoted Content')
          ),
          abort(),
          pipeCase(postIsJobPostings)(
            map((jobPostingsPost: CheerioStatic) => jobPostingsPost('[data-id]').attr('data-id')),
            log('Job Postings')
          ),
          abort(),
          pipeCase(postIsUserInteraction)(
            map((userInteractionPost: CheerioStatic) => userInteractionPost('[data-id]').attr('data-id')),
            log(`Followed User's Interaction (ie like, comment, etc)`)
          ),
          abort(),
          pipeCase(postIsUserPost)(
            pipeCase(postIsAuthoredByAPerson(...peopleNames))(
              likeUserPost(post),
              log('User Article "liked"')
            ),
            emptyPipe,
            log('User Article')
          ),
          abort(),
          // default case
          pipe()(
            map((unhandledPost: CheerioStatic) => unhandledPost('[data-id]').text()),
            log('Unhandled Post Case')
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
```

## Messaging
These BotAction's focus on operating in the main Messaging area of LinkedIn's web app.

### toggleMessagingOverlay
```typescript
const toggleMessagingOverlay: BotAction =
  click(messagingOverlayHeaderSelector)
```

By default, when someone logs into the LinkedIn web app, the "Messaging" center in the bottom-right is open, covering part of the web app. This BotAction will toggle that "Messaging" overlay open and close.

## Selectors

Helpful HTML element selectors in the LinkedIn web app:
```typescript
// Selectors for Messaging Overlay
export const messagingOverlayHeaderSelector = 'header.msg-overlay-bubble-header'

// Selectors for the main News Feeds
export const feedPostsSelector = '.application-outlet .feed-outlet [role="main"] div[data-id]'
export const feedPostAuthorSelector = '.feed-shared-actor__title'
```

## Helpers

These functions are not BotAction's, but useful in creating a web bot for Linkedin.
