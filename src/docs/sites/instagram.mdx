Botmation v2.x has a few special BotAction's included in for creating web bots that crawl the Instagram web app.

> These Instagram functions are `deprecated` in Botmation v2.x. They will be deleted in Botmation v3.x. Before that, those functions will be published in a new npm module, same license as before. This way, Botmation can focus on the building blocks of web bots and other npm modules can exist for each domain and speciality.

## Overview

The current set of BotAction's are for the initial login flow. Here is a working [example](https://github.com/mrWh1te/Botmation/blob/master/src/examples/instagram.ts) of them in use.

## login() BotAction

## isGuest ConditionalBotAction

## isLoggedIn ConditionalBotAction

## isTurnOnNotificationsModalActive ConditionalBotAction

## closeTurnOnNotificationsModal BotAction
