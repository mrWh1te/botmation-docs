These higher order functions provide simple ways to change the Page's URL.

## Go To
```typescript
goTo(url: string, goToOptions?: DirectNavigationOptions) => BotAction
```  
Navigates the page to the url provided, unless the active url is the url provided, then it emits a warning in the console
  
Default `goToOptions` are provided, therefore, optional. You can override the defaults with whatever you want, it follows the `DirectNavigationOptions` from the `@types/puppeteer` package

## Go Back
```typescript
goBack(options?: NavigationOptions) => BotAction
```
Similar to hitting the browser's "Back" button, to load the previous URL.

## Go Forward
```typescript
goForward(options?: NavigationOptions) => BotAction
```
Similar to hitting the brower's "Forward" button, to go forward after going back.

## Reload
```typescript
reload(options?: NavigationOptions) => BotAction
```
Similar to hitting the brower's "Refresh" button, to reload the page with the same URL.

## Wait for Navigation
```typescript
waitForNavigation: BotAction
```
Simply awaits Puppeteer's Page's `waitForNavigation` async method that can be helpful when navigating Single Page Applications after submitting a form that causes the page to change, so we can wait until the Page completes navigation before continuing.
