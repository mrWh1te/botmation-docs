These higher order functions provide a simple way to load and save cookies from and to a Puppeteer page.

You can configure where the cookie JSON files are saved/loaded by using `BotOptions` as an inject or as a higher-order param. Higher-order param values override injected ones.

Also, these functions are compatible with the higher-order `files()()` `BotAction` to configure the URL's for files during assembly for the declared actions.

## Save Cookies
```typescript
saveCookies(fileName: string, botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>) => BotFilesAction
```
Saves the cookies from the Puppeteer page in a JSON file with the name provided

## Load Cookies
```typescript
loadCookies(fileName: string, botFileOptions?: Partial<BotFileOptions>) => BotFilesAction
```
Loads the cookies from the file specified into the Puppeteer page
